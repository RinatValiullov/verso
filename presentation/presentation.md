# Rust, by example

_Illustrated along the way by `verso|recto`_

-----

I'm going to use my side project, `verso|recto`, to illustrate some basic Rust
ideas.

`verso|recto` is a literate programming tool that lets you include source code
in prose documents. 

Documents like this slide show.

-----

## Example 1

This is the script that builds this presentation:

```bash
@@buildsh
```

You can find the source for `verso|recto` at:

Don't worry; we'll have lots of code examples right here in the presentation, so
no need to follow along.
